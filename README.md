Welcome!

I am a former teacher who is interested in accessibility and providing tools to make our world a more equitable place.

I have been coding on and off since 2006, starting with C, C#, and, later, Python. Then, in the Fall of 2020, I started studying HTML and Javascript for a coding club I was running for a group of 6th graders. This interest quickly turned into a love for frontend development, and so I set out to get a better grasp of HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I then spent the next several months taking online courses while creating a Minesweeper game using vanilla Javascript (see Bomb Squad repo). By summer 2021, I was ready to expand to React, Ruby, and expanded my interests to include backend develoment. That is when I got involved with Uncover Education after networking with the owner, who is also a former teacher. We have since then developed the MVP for GoPursue, an app built to assist students with career exploration. While I continue to maintain and update the app, I also am expanding into React Native, TypeScript, and Django.
