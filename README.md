I am Michael Hazeltine. Welcome to my repository.

I have been coding on and off since 2006, though I only fully took the deep plunge in back in Fall 2020 when I started exploring Javascript for a virtual coding club I was running for a group of 6th graders. I quickly discovered a love for front-end development and set out to get a better grasp of HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I then spent the next several months creating a Minesweeper game using vanilla Javascript (see Bomb Squad repo) while taking several online courses. By summer 2021, I was ready to expand to React, Ruby, and more backend. That is when I got involved with Uncover Education with another teacher. We found we both had skills that the other needed and are currently setting out to develop a career exploration app for middle and high schoolers (GoPursue).
